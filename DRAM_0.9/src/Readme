The DRAM_0.3 updates the problems with C:Chl ratios in flexible models.
Previously, Pahlow et al. (2013) assumes that when I < Ithreshold, ThetaHat is very small.
But the data shows that it is not that low. So I decide to modify this to remove the effect of
bleach.

DRAM_0.4 tries to use the same set of parameters to fit the data of the two stations.
